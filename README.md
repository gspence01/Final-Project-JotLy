# JotLog
## What is JotLog?
Hey there! JotLog is a project I am working on for my final project with SDSU Digital Skills bootcamp. This is user authenticated social media app inspired by the apps Twitter and Vent. For now, I plan for JotLog to be a text-based platform for users to submit either public or private journal entries. 

## How to use JotLog
JotLog is user authenticated, so there will be a sign-up / log-in page for users. Once the user is logged in, there will be a page to view public entries by other members and another page to view private entries submitted by that particular user. If a user wants to post their own journal entry, there will be a modal to write in, where they can submit a title and any text they wish to add. There will also be an option to make the post public for others to view or private for their own viewing. 

## So what technologies will I be using?
I plan to make this application PERN stack. I will use postgres and Sequelize to configure a database holding the user information, all the posts, and (if time and/or the universe permits lmao) comments.

## Bugs and unfinished functionality TBD (you know there will be a lot lmao)
